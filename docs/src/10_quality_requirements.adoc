=== Quality Scenarios

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Attribute | Description | Metric

| **Response time**
| Time the system takes to react after a user's abstraction
| The system should respond to user actions within 1 second

| **Currency**
| System's capacity to support different games and users at the same time
| The system should support at least 25 simultaneous games or users without noticeable lag

| **Intuitiveness**
| Ease with which players can understand and play the game in a short period of time
| New players should be able to understand and play the game within 10 minutes.

| **Continuity**
| System's capacity to keep games and sessions active, keeping their progress updated
| At least 90% of games and sessions should maintain their progress after interruptions.

| **Modularization**
| Organizational quality, where different functionalities of the program are located in different modules, so that changes in one part do not affect others
| The program should be organized in at least 3 independent modules to isolate changes

| **API access**
| Secure control to the game funcitionalities, avoiding non authorized uses of the game
| All unauthorized API requests should be blocked to prevent misuse

| **User's information**
| Users' data protection, granting privacy and integrity.
| User critical data should be properly protected and encrypted
