== Architecture Decisions

=== ADR 1: Microservices architecture
* **Context:** The platform is expected to scale with increasing user demand, evolve over time with new features or game modes, and support parallel development by multiple team members. High availability and maintainability are important non-functional requirements.
* **Status:** Accepted by the teacher and development team.
* **Decision:** We decided to implement a microservice-based architecture with a clear separation between game logic, web APIs, and presentation layers. The system will consist of an independent Game Server (Rust) handling core game rules and state, a Web Application Server (Node.js + Express + TypeScript) exposing APIs and coordinating requests, and a Frontend application (React + Vite + TypeScript) for user interaction. Persistent data will be managed through a backend-controlled SQLite database. +
This approach allows each component to evolve independently while using the most appropriate technology for its responsibilities.
* **Pros:** 
** Clear separation of concerns between game logic, web APIs, and user interface.
** Enables independent development and deployment of the Game Server and Web Application Server.
* **Cons:**
** Increased architectural complexity compared to a single monolithic backend.
** Introduces inter-service communication overhead and potential latency.

=== ADR 2: Rust for Game Server
* **Context:** The game server must be performant, safe, and reliable, as errors in the game logic could compromise fairness or stability. Additionally, the engine may need to handle multiple concurrent games and interact efficiently with other services in the system.
* **Status:** Accepted by the teacher and development team.
* **Decision:** We decided to implement the Game Server using Rust, which provides strong compile-time guarantees for memory safety and concurrency without relying on a garbage collector. This makes it well-suited for implementing complex game logic that must be both efficient and robust.
* **Pros:** 
** Strong memory safety guarantees, reducing runtime errors and crashes.
** Highg performance and excellent support for concurrency, which is important for managing game sessions in parallel.
* **Cons:**
** Steeper learnig curve, as the development team is not familiar with this programming language.

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.
