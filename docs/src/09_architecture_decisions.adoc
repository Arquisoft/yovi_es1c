== Architecture Decisions

=== ADR 1: Microservices architecture
* **Context:** The platform is expected to scale with increasing user demand, evolve over time with new features or game modes, and support parallel development by multiple team members. High availability and maintainability are important non-functional requirements.
* **Status:** Accepted by the teacher and development team.
* **Decision:** We decided to implement a microservice-based architecture with a clear separation between game logic, web APIs, and presentation layers. The system will consist of an independent Game Server (Rust) handling core game rules and state, a Web Application Server (Node.js + Express + TypeScript) exposing APIs and coordinating requests, and a Frontend application (React + Vite + TypeScript) for user interaction. Persistent data will be managed through a backend-controlled SQLite database. +
This approach allows each component to evolve independently while using the most appropriate technology for its responsibilities.
* **Pros:** 
** Clear separation of concerns between game logic, web APIs, and user interface.
** Enables independent development and deployment of the Game Server and Web Application Server.
* **Cons:**
** Increased architectural complexity compared to a single monolithic backend.
** Introduces inter-service communication overhead and potential latency.

=== ADR 2: Rust for Game Server
* **Context:** The game server must be performant, safe, and reliable, as errors in the game logic could compromise fairness or stability. Additionally, the engine may need to handle multiple concurrent games and interact efficiently with other services in the system.
* **Status:** Accepted by the teacher and development team.
* **Decision:** We decided to implement the Game Server using Rust, which provides strong compile-time guarantees for memory safety and concurrency without relying on a garbage collector. This makes it well-suited for implementing complex game logic that must be both efficient and robust.
* **Pros:** 
** Strong memory safety guarantees, reducing runtime errors and crashes.
** Highg performance and excellent support for concurrency, which is important for managing game sessions in parallel.
* **Cons:**
** Steeper learnig curve, as the development team is not familiar with this programming language.

=== ADR 3: Docker Containerization
* **Context:** The platform is composed of multiple independent components implemented with different technologies and runtimes. A way to ensure consistent development, testing, and deployment across different environments is essential to reduce configuration issues and simplify setup for new team members.
* **Status:** Accepted by the teacher and development team.
* **Decision:** We decided to containerize all major components of the system using Docker. Each service will run inside its own Docker container, with Docker Compose used to orchestrate and manage the multi-container setup. This ensures environment consistency and simplifies deployment and execution of the full system.
* **Pros:**
** Provides consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment.
** Simplifies setup and onboarding by reducing manual configuration.
** Enables easier deployment and scaling of individual services.
* **Cons:**
** Adds an extra layer of complexity to the development workflow.
** Requires basic knowledge of Docker and container orchestration from the development team.

=== ADR 4: SQLite as Database System
* **Context:** The application requires persistent storage for game data, user information, and match states. The database solution should be simple to operate, easy to integrate with the existing backend services, and appropriate for an academic project deployed in a cloud environment.
* **Status:** Proposed by the development team.
* **Decision:** We decided to use SQLite as the primary database system for the application. The SQLite database will be accessed exclusively by backend services. This choice is also highly based on the development team's experience using relational databases.
* **Pros:**
** Easy integration with backend services and containerized environments.
** Suitable for small-to-medium workloads.
** Low learning curve, as the development team is used to working with relational databases.
* **Cons:**
** Limited scalability and concurrency support compared to cloud-native database solutions.
** Not ideal for high-availability or horizontally scaled write-heavy workloads.
