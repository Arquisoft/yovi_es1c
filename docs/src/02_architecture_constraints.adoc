== Architecture Constraints

Before starting the design and implementation of YOVI, it is important to be aware of the constraints that will guide architectural decisions. 
These constraints reflect organizational limitations, technical choices, and mandatory practices that the development team must follow. 
Understanding them helps ensure that the architecture is feasible, maintainable, and aligned with project requirements.

=== Organizational Constraints

The following organizational constraints define the environment in which the YOVI system is developed.

|Constraint|Explanation

|Small team of 5 people|The entire solution must be developed and maintained by a small team, so simplicity, modularity, and ease of integration are prioritized.

|Delivery deadlines|The system must meet the deadlines set by the ASW project, including partial and final submissions.

|Mandatory testing|Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests must be performed during development to ensure system quality.

=== Technical Constraints

Technical constraints specify mandatory technologies, languages, and communication protocols that the system must adopt.

|Constraint|Explanation

|Frontend language: TypeScript|The web application must be implemented in TypeScript, so client-side logic must adhere to this ecosystem.

|Frontend framework: React|The web interface must be built using React, which influences component structure and state management.

|Game logic module language: Rust|Victory checking and move suggestion are implemented in Rust, constraining the communication interface and available libraries.

|Communication via JSON / YEN notation|All exchanges between the web application and the game logic module, as well as with the bot API, must use JSON messages in YEN format.

|Mandatory web deployment|The application must be deployed and publicly accessible, influencing architecture design for web hosting and basic scalability.

|Data persistence|Storage of users, games, and statistics is required, affecting database selection and backend organization.
