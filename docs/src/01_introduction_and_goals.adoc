== Introduction and Goals
YOVI is a web platform for playing the game Y, developed by Micrati.

The system is designed for both human users and automated agents (bots). Its primary goal is to provide a smooth and engaging user experience when playing against an Artificial Intelligence (AI),
with configurable board sizes and selectable difficulty levels.

YOVI consists of a React-based web frontend (running in the browser), an Auth Service (managing authentication and credentials), a Users Service (managing user profile data), a Game Service (handling match persistence and statistics), and a Rust-based Game Server (handling game logic). All backend services communicate via REST APIs using JSON messages, with YEN notation for game states, and are accessible through a single Nginx API Gateway.

This section summarizes the most relevant functional requirements from an architectural perspective.

=== Requirements Overview

The following table summarizes the main use cases of the system:

[options="header",cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Primary Actors|Use Case / Functionality|Description

|Player|Play Game|The player accesses the web application in their browser and starts a new game of Y. The React frontend displays a board with configurable size. The player takes turns placing pieces on the board. After each player move, the frontend sends the current game state in YEN notation to the Game Server via Nginx. The AI responds with its move, which is applied to the board and shown to the player. The Game Service persists each move in `game.db`. The system manages turns and checks after each move if the game has ended. The process repeats until a victory or defeat condition occurs.

|Player|Strategy Configuration|Before or during a game, the player selects a game strategy for the AI and an associated difficulty level through the React UI. The system stores this configuration in the Game Service and uses it whenever it requests the next move from the Game Server. The game state and selected strategy are sent to the Rust Game Server, which calculates the move accordingly.

|Registered Player|History and Statistics Management|A registered player accesses their profile within the web application. The React frontend requests statistics from the Game Service via Nginx. The system retrieves information associated with the user from `game.db`, including total games played, wins, losses, and other performance metrics. This information is presented in a structured manner in the UI, allowing the player to track progress and results over time.

|Player|User Registration and Authentication|A new player registers through the React frontend. The Auth Service receives the registration request, hashes the password, and stores the credentials in `auth.db`. On subsequent visits, the player logs in through the Auth Service, which validates credentials and returns a JWT token used to authenticate requests to other services.

|External Bot|API for External Bots|An external bot makes requests to the system API through Nginx to create games, check board state, or make moves. The bot sends the game state using YEN notation to the Game Server and receives responses in the same format. Authentication is handled by the Auth Service against `auth.db`, and match data is persisted by the Game Service in `game.db`.

|System (Game Server)|Move Validation and Suggestion|The Game Server receives the current game state in YEN notation from the React frontend (via Nginx). The Rust module determines if the game has ended and, if not, calculates the optimal next move according to the selected strategy. The result is returned to the frontend to update the game board. The Game Server is completely stateless and has no database access.

=== Quality Goals

The following table outlines the key quality attributes that are most important for the architecture of the YOVI system

[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
|Quality Attribute|Description

|Performance|The system must calculate moves and check victory conditions in suitable timeframes to ensure a smooth gameplay experience, even on variable-size boards.

|Scalability|The system must support multiple concurrent games and users, allowing growth without major architectural redesigns.

|Maintainability|The architecture should facilitate adding new strategies, Y game variants, or logic changes without impacting the rest of the system.

|Interoperability|The system must allow integration with external clients through a well-defined, documented, and interface-independent API.

|Usability|The web application should offer a clear and intuitive interface, enabling users to play games and consult information effortlessly.

|Security|The system should protect backend services from direct external access, handle authentication properly, and ensure data integrity through controlled and isolated database access per service.
