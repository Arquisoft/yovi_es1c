== Introduction and Goals
YOVI is a web platform for playing the game Y, developed by Micrati.

The system is designed for both human users and automated agents (bots). Its primary goal is to provide a smooth and engaging user experience when playing against an Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
with configurable board sizes and selectable difficulty levels.

YOVI consists of a TypeScript-based web application and a Rust-based game logic module, which communicate via JSON messages using the YEN notation.

This section summarizes the most relevant functional requirements from an architectural perspective.

=== Requirements Overview

The following table summarizes the main use cases of the system:

[options="header",cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Primary Actors|Use Case / Functionality|Description

|Player|Play Game|The player accesses the web application and starts a new game of Y. The system displays a board with configurable size. The player takes turns placing pieces on the board. After each player move, the system sends the current game state in YEN notation to the game logic module. The AI responds with its move, which is applied to the board and shown to the player. The system manages turns and checks after each move if the game has ended. The process repeats until a victory or defeat condition occurs.

|Player|Strategy Configuration|Before or during a game, the player selects a game strategy for the AI and an associated difficulty level. The system stores this configuration and uses it whenever it requests the next move from the AI. The game state and selected strategy are sent to the Rust logic module, which calculates the move accordingly.

|Registered Player|History and Statistics Management|A registered player accesses their profile within the web application. The system retrieves information associated with the user, including total games played, wins, losses, and other performance metrics. This information is presented in a structured manner, allowing the player to track progress and results over time.

|External Bot|API for External Bots|An external bot makes requests to the system API to create games, check board state, or make moves. The bot sends the game state using YEN notation and receives responses in the same format.

|System (Web App / API)|Move Validation and Suggestion|The system sends the current game state in YEN notation to the Rust game logic module. The module determines if the game has ended and, if not, calculates the optimal next move according to the selected strategy. The result is returned to the system to update the game or respond to an API request.

=== Quality Goals

The following table outlines the key quality attributes that are most important for the architecture of the YOVI system

[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
|Quality Attribute|Description

|Performance|The system must calculate moves and check victory conditions in suitable timeframes to ensure a smooth gameplay experience, even on variable-size boards.

|Scalability|The system must support multiple concurrent games and users, allowing growth without major architectural redesigns.

|Maintainability|The architecture should facilitate adding new strategies, Y game variants, or logic changes without impacting the rest of the system.

|Interoperability|The system must allow integration with external clients through a well-defined, documented, and interface-independent API.

|Usability|The web application should offer a clear and intuitive interface, enabling users to play games and consult information effortlessly.
