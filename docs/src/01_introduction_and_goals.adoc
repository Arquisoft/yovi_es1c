== Introduction and Goals
YOVI is a web platform for playing the game Y, developed by Micrati.

The system is designed for both human users and automated agents (bots). Its primary goal is to provide a smooth and engaging user experience when playing against an Artificial Intelligence (AI),
with configurable board sizes and selectable difficulty levels.

YOVI consists of a React-based web frontend (running in the browser), a Node.js-based Users Service (managing authentication and database access), and a Rust-based Game Server (handling game logic), which communicate via REST APIs using JSON messages with YEN notation for game states.

This section summarizes the most relevant functional requirements from an architectural perspective.

=== Requirements Overview

The following table summarizes the main use cases of the system:

[options="header",cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Primary Actors|Use Case / Functionality|Description

|Player|Play Game|The player accesses the web application in their browser and starts a new game of Y. The React frontend displays a board with configurable size. The player takes turns placing pieces on the board. After each player move, the frontend sends the current game state in YEN notation to the Game Server via Nginx. The AI responds with its move, which is applied to the board and shown to the player. The system manages turns and checks after each move if the game has ended. The process repeats until a victory or defeat condition occurs.

|Player|Strategy Configuration|Before or during a game, the player selects a game strategy for the AI and an associated difficulty level through the React UI. The system stores this configuration in the Users Service and uses it whenever it requests the next move from the Game Server. The game state and selected strategy are sent to the Rust Game Server, which calculates the move accordingly.

|Registered Player|History and Statistics Management|A registered player accesses their profile within the web application. The React frontend requests statistics from the Users Service via Nginx. The system retrieves information associated with the user, including total games played, wins, losses, and other performance metrics from the SQLite database. This information is presented in a structured manner in the UI, allowing the player to track progress and results over time.

|External Bot|API for External Bots|An external bot makes requests to the system API through Nginx to create games, check board state, or make moves. The bot sends the game state using YEN notation to the Game Server and receives responses in the same format. Authentication is handled by the Users Service.

|System (Game Server)|Move Validation and Suggestion|The Game Server receives the current game state in YEN notation from the React frontend (via Nginx). The Rust module determines if the game has ended and, if not, calculates the optimal next move according to the selected strategy. The result is returned to the frontend to update the game board.

=== Quality Goals

The following table outlines the key quality attributes that are most important for the architecture of the YOVI system

[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
|Quality Attribute|Description

|Performance|The system must calculate moves and check victory conditions in suitable timeframes to ensure a smooth gameplay experience, even on variable-size boards.

|Scalability|The system must support multiple concurrent games and users, allowing growth without major architectural redesigns.

|Maintainability|The architecture should facilitate adding new strategies, Y game variants, or logic changes without impacting the rest of the system.

|Interoperability|The system must allow integration with external clients through a well-defined, documented, and interface-independent API.

|Usability|The web application should offer a clear and intuitive interface, enabling users to play games and consult information effortlessly.

|Security|The system should protect backend services from direct external access, handle authentication properly, and ensure data integrity through controlled database access.
