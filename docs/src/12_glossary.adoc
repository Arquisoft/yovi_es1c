|Term |Definition


|*API Gateway*
|Architectural component that serves as the single public entry point, routing client requests to backend services and managing cross-cutting concerns

|*Nginx*
|Web server and reverse proxy used to implement the API Gateway pattern in this system

|*Anonymous Play*
|Game mode where unregistered users can play without persisting their statistics or match history

|*Arc42*
|Architecture documentation template followed in this project for structural consistency

|*BFF (Backend for Frontend)*
|Architectural pattern where the Web App Server orchestrates calls to multiple backend services (Users Service and Game Server)

|*Barycentric Coordinates*
|Coordinate system (x, y, z) used to represent positions on the hexagonal game board

|*Board*
|Hexagonal grid representing the Y game playing surface

|*Bot Client*
|External automated agent that plays through the system's Bot API

|*CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)*
|HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate which origins are permitted to access its resources from a browser

|*Docker*
|Containerization platform used for packaging and deploying all system services

|*Game Server*
|Rust-based microservice responsible for core game logic, move validation, and bot AI strategies

|*Match*
|Game session between two players (human or bot) with a specific board size and strategy configuration

|*Microservices*
|Distributed architecture pattern where the system is decomposed into independent services (Frontend, Web App Server, Users Service, Game Server)

|*Move/Movement*
|Player action placing a piece at specific coordinates on the board

|*PlantUML*
|Tool used for generating architectural diagrams throughout the documentation

|*Registered Player*
|User with an account who can access match history, statistics, and personalized features

|*Reverse Proxy*
|Server (Nginx) that forwards client requests to appropriate backend services and returns responses

|*SQLite*
|Embedded relational database used for persisting users, matches, and statistics

|*Stateless Service*
|Service that does not maintain persistent state between requests (e.g., Game Server)

|*Strategy*
|AI difficulty level and bot behavior configuration (e.g., random, heuristic)

|*Upstream*
|Nginx configuration directive defining a group of backend servers that can handle requests (e.g., users_backend, gamey_backend)

|*Users Service*
|Node.js microservice that acts as the single point of access to the database, managing authentication, user accounts, match persistence, and statistics

|*WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)*
|SQLite mode that enables concurrent reads during writes, improving database performance

|*Web App Server*
|Node.js/Express/TypeScript service implementing the BFF pattern, orchestrating requests between Frontend, Users Service, and Game Server

|*Win Checker*
|Algorithm that detects Y-shaped winning connections on the board to determine game outcome

|*YBot*
|Rust trait/interface defining the contract for bot strategy implementations

|*YEN (Y-Encoded Notation)*
|Domain-specific format for representing board positions and moves in the Y game, used for inter-service communication
